Energy has not been really considered a major topic in people displacement, yet, resulting in negative impacts on several aspects, including food security. New solutions are required, in terms of energy planning, technology development, and adaptation, as well as decision making, sensitization, training, and support to humanitarian actors. The Sustainable Energy Technologies for food security (SET4food) project phase 1 (2014–2015) developed a number of tools to support identification, adaptation, and introduction of appropriate solutions, tested some pilot innovations in critical areas, and promoted the enhancement of humanitarian response capability in the energy sector via an extensive capacity building program. In addition, a second phase of the project (2015–2018) fostered networking and collaboration between the main actors by developing an e-sharing platform, called ENERGYCoP, including a global not-for-profit community of practices for humanitarian professionals working in the energy sector. The platform may enable the shift from traditional “technological transfer” to a more participative approach on co-design and technological cooperation activated by a knowledge sharing mechanism. This paper outlines the main challenges and the achieved results of SET4food, providing recommendations for researchers and practitioners on the way forward.","2018-07-01","2023-03-21 15:24:48","2023-10-03 07:58:46","2023-03-21 15:24:47","11","","1","3","","Int J Humanitarian Action","Towards an holistic approach to energy access in humanitarian settings","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p>The document ""Towards an holistic approach to energy access in humanitarian settings: the SET4food project from technology transfer to knowledge sharing"" outlines the SET4food project's approach to improving energy access in humanitarian settings.</p> <p>The project aims to promote a holistic approach to energy access, which takes into account the interdependence of energy access with food security, nutrition, and health outcomes.

Specifically, an evidence base was built around two community co-conceived standalone photovoltaic-battery systems, which were deployed in two refugee camps in Rwanda. We found that for both installations (a micro-grid and a community hall electrification system) energy consumption levels were low, showing that sizeable energy consumption gaps can still develop when co-conceived interventions are deployed. The consumption gap led to low performance ratios (33% and 25% respectively for the micro-grid and community hall system). To guide further work and improve the sustainability of community interventions, we draw a number of design principles for future energy interventions in similar contexts. To deliver sustainable energy transitions for refugees, there needs to be a move towards co-creating community interventions that promote self-governance to position communities as users, maintainers and suppliers of energy services, throughout an intervention's lifetime.","2021-12-01","2023-03-22 07:24:26","2023-10-03 07:58:46","2021-11-08 12:57:17","175-184","","","65","","Energy for Sustainable Development","The challenges of community-based solar energy interventions","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/benrobinson/Zotero/storage/DCZDKW8X/Nixon et al. - 2021 - The challenges of community-based solar energy int.pdf","","PROJECT STEP: Implementation; PROJECT STEP: M&E; THEME: Capacity Building & Sharing; CO-DESIGN LEVEL: 1; CASE STUDY GROUP: IDP; CASE STUDY GROUP: Refugee; CASE STUDY LEVEL: Community; CASE STUDY TECH: Cooking; CASE STUDY TECH: Lighting; ACCESS: Open Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To provide insights, this paper presents the results of a systematic and comprehensive review of 155 peer-reviewed articles published across eight databases between January 2008 and December 2019. The aim is firstly to review the current state of the art in the energy justice literature and, secondly, to present findings that support novel recommendations with the potential to enhance the impact of energy justice research, including applications in the economic and planning policy sectors. Critically, our study demonstrates that the literature lacks diversity in its author basis and research design. By contrast, conceptual frameworks and the geographies and technologies of global energy injustice are proliferating. These results illustrate that energy justice has power and agency as a tool. It can act as a protagonist in energy research, provoking researchers to remain reflexively normative and active in identifying injustices and vulnerabilities, and it can act as a promising progenitor, creating new research methods and themes.","2021-03","2023-03-22 08:43:02","2023-10-03 07:40:14","2023-03-22 08:43:02","043009","","4","16","","Environ.

It discusses the various methodologies used to study energy justice, such as quantitative and qualitative approaches, and highlights the importance of interdisciplinary and participatory research. The document also examines the geographical scope of energy justice research, with a focus on both developed and developing countries, and discusses the ways in which energy justice intersects with issues of race, class, and gender.

This article draws on experiences from Kenya where aid interventions have shaped politics, social dynamics and economic life since the 1990s. Kakuma camp and Kalobeyei settlement serve as empirical windows to explore the limits of institutional decampment and reform policies, while demonstrating that more radical, abolitionist struggles are enacted through everyday mobilisation and acts of fugitivity among refugees themselves.

Maps created by local communities represent the place in which they live, showing features communities themselves perceive as important such as customary land boundaries, how they use the forest, sacred areas, and so on. The process used to create participatory maps can be very valuable in itself. They are planned around a common community goal and should be made with input from an entire community. The result is a product that represents the knowledge of the entire community. Participatory mapping can use a variety of different techniques, ranging from ‘earth maps’ (usually a drawing in sand in a communal space in a village) to sophisticated digital maps using a GIS (geographic information system). Where the maps are intended to inform outside groups, they follow recognised cartographic conventions. It is a powerful tool that allows remote and marginalised communities to represent themselves spatially, bringing their local knowledge and perspectives to the attention of governmental authorities and decision-makers.","","2023-03-28 10:17:34","2023-10-03 07:55:20","2023-03-28 10:17:34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en-GB","","","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p>Participatory mapping is a general term used to define a set of approaches and techniques that combines the tools of modern cartography with participatory methods to record and represent the spatial knowledge of local communities.</p> </div>","","","PROJECT STEP: Design; USEFUL FOR: UN/INGO; USEFUL FOR: NGO/Other; USEFUL FOR: Policy/Governments; USEFUL FOR: Private Sector; PROJECT STEP: Needs Assessment; PROJECT STEP: Implementation; PROJECT STEP: Stakholder Mapping; PROJECT STEP: M&E; USEFUL FOR: Community; ACCESS: Open Access; TOOLS: Participatory Approaches","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This toolkit is targeted towards impact entrepreneurs, intrapreneurs, partnership brokers and facilitators, and accelerators supporting impact entrepreneurs who are initiating value chain partnerships, partnerships where organizations seek to integrate existing or create new value chains to bring these innovations to market. Designed to maximize partnership success, P.ACT offers four unique features: Co-design process: A four stage co-design framework to ensure inclusive participation and continuous engagement of all partners. Value focus: Emphasis on defining both the value created and the value captured through the partnership. It focuses the partners' attention on generating value for their customers and beneficiaries as well as for their organizations.

This paper addresses these by presenting an overview of the household and small enterprise electricity access situation in Kigeme, Nyabiheke and Gihembe camps in Rwanda and through the application of a Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal and Environmental (PESTLE) analysis to assess the barriers influencing solar home system provision. Most households and small enterprises currently have limited or no access to electricity and there is significant unmet demand for energy services such as mobile phone charging, lighting, and entertainment in the camps. The analysis suggests that solar home systems can meet these energy needs and identifies important factors in ensuring projects are successful. Projects should be informed by the needs and priorities of end-users and should be aligned with national policies, such as achieving Tier 2 energy access, to garner political support. Where possible, local market systems should be nurtured to normalise paying for energy products and to avoid free distribution. This can support private sector engagement and result in longer system lifetimes through improved maintenance. Energy literacy programmes can also improve awareness of solar home systems and their benefits compared to traditional sources of energy. These findings can inform practitioners on the supporting policy/financial frameworks, design requirements and implementation measures needed to maximise the benefits of future solar home system projects and help achieve electrification targets.","2021-06-01","2023-03-31 08:02:43","2023-10-03 07:58:26","","110872","","","143","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p>This paper applied the PESTLE tool (<span style=""color: rgb(46, 46, 46)"">Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal and Environmental) as a framework to understand the barriers to solar home system provision. </span></p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(46, 46, 46)"">A summary of the PESTLE tool can be found here - </span><a href=""https://www.cipd.co.uk/knowledge/strategy/organisational-development/pestle-analysis-factsheet#gref"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"">https://www.cipd.co.uk/knowledge/strategy/organisational-development/pestle-analysis-factsheet#gref</a> - this tool is used primarily for trend identification for factors outside of your own organization. </p> <p>PESTLE is also outlined by the Humanitarian Innovation Fund’s Humanitarian Innovation Guide - <a href=""https://higuide.elrha.org/toolkits/recognition/initial-impressions/identify-trends/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"">https://higuide.elrha.org/toolkits/recognition/initial-impressions/identify-trends/</a></p> </div>","","","PROJECT STEP: Design; USEFUL FOR: UN/INGO; USEFUL FOR: Policy/Governments; USEFUL FOR: Private Sector; CO-DESIGN LEVEL: 2; SUPPORTING TOOLKIT: Systems Approaches to Energy Access; ACCESS: Open Access; TOOLS: Technical Approaches","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It focuses on two main sets of challenges: first, the difficulties of constructing an ethical consent process and obtaining genuinely informed consent; and second, taking fully into account and responding to refugee participants' capacities for autonomy. The authors also discuss the challenges involved in applying the central normative principles governing ethics review processes—the principles of beneficence, integrity, respect for persons, autonomy and justice—to the context of refugee research. It is argued that researchers should seek ways to move beyond harm minimization as a standard for ethical research and recognize an obligation to design and conduct research projects that aim to bring about reciprocal benefits for refugee participants and/or communities. Some of the methodological issues raised by this analysis are discussed in the conclusion.","2007","2023-03-31 08:02:43","2023-10-03 07:46:38","","299-319","","2","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p>This paper promoted the “Hanging Out” methodology which champions the spending of intentional and extended time with the focus groups of qualitative research studies.</p> </div>","","","PROJECT STEP: Design; USEFUL FOR: NGO/Other; USEFUL FOR: Policy/Governments; PROJECT STEP: Implementation; PROJECT STEP: M&E; CO-DESIGN LEVEL: 1; ACCESS: Institutional Access; THEME: Humanitarian Principles?","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A shift to advanced cookstoves can bring significant health and environmental benefits, but only with near exclusive use which requires significant changes in users’ behaviours. Since the emergence of the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves (now the Clean Cooking Alliance) in 2011, more attention has been directed to consumer and demand side factors in clean cookstove adoption and efforts to better understand individuals’ behaviours, household dynamics and decision making around the adoption of clean cookstoves and fuels have increased. This paper presents a review of the academic literature (2013–2020) and aims to identify the most successful interventions of behaviour change techniques in the adoption of improved cookstoves as well as the most common barriers to success cited in the literature. The study sourced 40 peer reviewed published academic papers from spring 2013 to summer 2020, and identified the following most commonly used behaviour change techniques in the adoption of improved cookstoves: Shaping Knowledge (n = 19), Reward & Threat (n = 13), Social Support (n = 9), Comparisons (n = 4), Identity/Self-Belief (n = 4), Regulation (n = 0), Change in the Physical Environment (n = 2), Goals & Planning (n = 6).

The use of new communications and database technologies in LMICs is generating ‘big data’ (for example from the use of mobile phones, mobile-based financial services and the internet) which is collected and processed by corporations. When shared, these data are also becoming a potentially valuable resource for development research and policy. With these new sources of data, new power structures are emerging within the field of development. We identify two trends in particular, illustrating them with examples: first, the empowerment of public–private partnerships around datafication in LMICs and the consequently growing agency of corporations as development actors. Second, the way commercially generated big data is becoming the foundation for country-level ‘data doubles’, i.e. digital representations of social phenomena and/or territories that are created in parallel with, and sometimes in lieu of, national data and statistics.

This work applies a multi-disciplinary methodology to develop an energy demand modelling framework for Tier 0 refugee camps, and assesses the implementation of alternative power supply systems. It does so by not only focusing on its techno-economic feasibility, but equally through investigating the challenges on adoption in the specific context of refugee camps, by undertaking interviews with relevant stakeholders in the humanitarian sector. The modelling application has been performed for the Mantapala refugee camp, in Zambia, enabling the comparison of different combinations of power supply systems against current diesel-based solutions, using HOMER software. Results show that the implementation of hybrid renewable energy systems is viable, both technically and economically, with energy costs being reduced up to 50%, with paybacks lower than five years.

Within the past 20 years, the topic of energy access has increasingly made its way into the humanitarian field. Despite the direction of this emerging niche, interventions rarely bring about its intended outcomes. Building on participant observations collected among a multitude of stakeholders and ethnographic data from the Ugandan refugee settlement Rhino Camp, the paper has two main aims. First, we draw into question reigning assumptions among energy stakeholders that often explain the slow progress toward increasing energy access within displacement settings by way of recipient’s cultural disposition and lack of knowledge. Second, advancing the concept of transactional communities encompassing refugees and hosts, this article contributes to critical studies on energy transitions by not only viewing cooking as an individual or cultural practice, but also a social practice built upon interdependency and reciprocity. Including the perspectives of both refugees and host communities serves to pre-empt the protracted situation of refugee settlements, stressing the importance of considering transactional parties as a more durable entity that transcends temporary and problematic notions of refugee and host.","2020-05-01","2023-03-31 08:02:43","2023-07-27 12:35:20","","101404","","","63","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p>Behind pay-wall.</p> </div>","","","PROJECT STEP: Design; USEFUL FOR: UN/INGO; USEFUL FOR: NGO/Other; PROJECT STEP: Implementation; PROJECT STEP: M&E; TOOLS: Multidisciplinary Approaches","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper aims to explore the ways in which co-design is conceptualised and applied, from an interdisciplinary perspective, within the socio-technical framing. We do this by first conducting a rapid review of relevant co-design literature to understand theories, typologies and identify methods of best co-design practice in the Humanitarian Energy sector. Second, we present the Humanitarian Engineering and Energy for Displacement project as a co-design case study for Humanitarian Energy using Technology Implementation Model for Energy (TIME) as a framework for analysis. Our rapid review resulted in the typology of the Spectrum of Co-Design, a mapping of differing conceptualisations of co-design showing their positioning and interactions. Our results show that by exploring if and how conceptual frameworks, such as TIME, adds value to practitioner orientated humanitarian programming this can make a significant contribution to future proofing energy systems that seek to deliver inclusive, sustainable and just transitions.

Refugee communities are vibrant hotbeds of innovation, where migrants transfer knowledge and skills to new environments and entrepreneurship happens of necessity. Thus, there are many benefits that might flow to countries that embrace the innovative potential of refugees. At the same time, the world’s refugee population is growing faster than humanitarian aid’s capacity to keep up with the needs of refugees. To address this gap, the international community through policies such as the UN Global Compact for Refugees is calling for more sustainable solutions to ensure refugee self-reliance. Innovation and entrepreneurship in the informal sector is a promising path towards greater self-reliance. Countering the narrative that refugees are a drain on society, this chapter examines innovation by refugees in the informal sector in Uganda both within and outside of refugee camps. It showcases ways in which refugees have provided innovative solutions to community-faced problems that benefit both the host and refugee communities.","2020-09-18","2023-04-18 07:00:58","2023-10-03 07:43:47","2023-04-18 07:00:58","387-409","","","","","","Innovation in refugee economies","","","","","","","en_US","","","","","www.elgaronline.com","","ISBN: 9781788972802 Publisher: Edward Elgar Publishing Section: Research Handbook on Development and the Informal Economy","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p>The document discusses the importance of supporting intermediaries that facilitate the growth of informal economies in refugee communities.

Adoption decision stages of preference, intention, and choice to install a toilet in Ghana are defined, measured in a survey, and used to estimate sanitation demand, identify factors affecting demand at each stage, and classify households by adoption stage to identify targeted demand-stimulation strategies. Results from a representative national sample of 536 households indicate that of 74% of households without any home sanitation, 31% have some likelihood of installing a toilet within the next year, but only 6% are very likely to do so; 62% had not considered the idea. Motivating and constraining factors are compared at each adoption stage and strategies likely to increase toilet installation in Ghana discussed.

Serious games are a possible approach to explain complex relationships and present them to citizens. This paper discusses the development process of the serious board game “Changing the Game—Neighbourhood”. Therefore, this paper describes our approach of developing a serious game with co-designers in four phases and illustrates the process using an example. Doing so, the paper focus on two central challenges: (1) How can a serious game be developed for the energy transition, which keeps a balance between learning and playability? (2) How can co-design contribute to the development of a serious game? We found out that the use of prototypes and the inﬂuence of diﬀerent stakeholders as informants, co-designers, and testers were crucial for the expansion of the learning content, the improvement of the gameplay, and the balancing of the diﬃculty level. In addition, the energy transition at the neighborhood level appeared to be a suitable topic for a serious game.

It also identified both demand in the camps for modern energy services and a willingness and ability to pay. To address the lack of access to electricity, two solar home system companies operating in Rwanda were supported by the project to access the camps and supply systems to refugees and the host community via marketbased delivery models. This paper applies the diffusion of innovations theory as a framework to investigate the sales of solar home systems in the camps. It is the first paper to present data in this area and it assesses both the viability of market-based delivery of solar home systems in refugee camps and the suitability of using diffusion of innovations theory in these contexts. The results indicate that solar home systems can provide an advantage to households compared to existing energy solutions and are, in most cases, compatible with refugees' basic energy needs and expectations. However, the cost of systems remains a barrier and without subsidy, further reductions in costs or adaptations to payment models, solar home systems are unlikely to provide large proportions of households and small enterprises in the camps with access to energy. This seriously impacts the possibility of achieving Sustainable Development Goal 7 and for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to achieve the objectives it set out in its Clean Energy Challenge policy.","2021-08","2023-04-26 05:54:36","2023-10-03 07:56:55","2023-04-26 05:54:36","119-132","","","63","","Energy for Sustainable Development","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/benrobinson/Zotero/storage/PD6Z2C6V/Thomas et al. - 2021 - The diffusion of solar home systems in Rwandan ref.pdf","","PROJECT STEP: Design; USEFUL FOR: UN/INGO; USEFUL FOR: Policy/Governments; USEFUL FOR: Private Sector; ACCESS: Open Access; TOOLS: Technical Approaches","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To date, there have been numerous interventions targeting improved cooking solutions in displacement settings, but very few which have involved modern energy cooking, such as ethanol, biogas, LPG or electric cooking. They have been largely absent from humanitarian programming due to limited availability, affordability and lack of business models that suit those complex settings. Additionally, energy access services in displacement settings have historically relied primarily on grant-based funding. However, grants are limited to relatively short timeframes which do not align with the long-term needs of the displaced. New ways of funding energy access in displacement settings, and particularly modern energy cooking services, are urgently needed to address the scale of the challenge as the number of displaced surpassed 80 million in 2020, with close to 90% having little or no access to adequate cooking fuels and technologies. In this paper, we review modern energy cooking in displacement settings and the common ways of funding and delivering them. We argue that new ways of funding and delivering energy access in displacement settings are urgently needed to address the scale of the challenge and to facilitate transitions to modern energy cooking fuels and technologies, in line with Sustainable Development Goal 7 and the principle of ‘leaving no one behind’.","2021-07-10","2023-04-26 05:47:39","2023-10-03 07:48:00","2023-04-26 05:47:39","4176","","14","14","","Energies","Funding and Delivery Models for Modern Energy Cooking Services in Displacement Settings","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/benrobinson/Zotero/storage/YM58G7M3/Bisaga and To - 2021 - Funding and Delivery Models for Modern Energy Cook.pdf","","USEFUL FOR: NGO/Other; USEFUL FOR: Private Sector; PROJECT STEP: Implementation; THEME: Systems Approaches to Energy Access; CO-DESIGN LEVEL: 2; ACCESS: Open Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But people who have been forced to flee their homes, some 80 per cent of whom find refuge in low- and middle-income countries, nearly always remain outside national energy policy and planning mechanisms, even though most live and work within a local economy.  This research paper draws on five case studies – focusing on Ethiopia, Jordan, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda – to explore how humanitarian efforts to scale up access to sustainable energy for refugees and other displaced communities are affected by policy and governance structures in host countries.  The authors underscore that national energy polices and ambitions for low-carbon development pathways need to be accompanied by frameworks that support integration and self-reliance for displaced people, including through rights to work, move and participate freely in host economies.

There are still many unanswered questions as to how to deliver energy in a sustainable, efficient and cost-effective manner in refugee camps. This work highlights the need for evidence-based assessments and development of comprehensive delivery approaches. While many humanitarian energy projects do not include an assessment or design phase, detailed assessment before project implementation is critical to ensure long-term success. A lack of quality data can lead to poorly designed interventions. To understand the full range of energy needs, qualitative and lived experience information is also essential. Humanitarian agencies need to develop sustainable interventions that work directly with refugees, displaced people, and host communities to access reliable, more affordable and sustainable energy to support the transition of refugee camps to self-reliant and economically developed spaces. Finally, the study emphasizes that delivering wide-ranging sustainable energy solutions in refugee camps is complex and requires collaborative efforts from different stakeholders taking into account people’s existing knowledge, energy practices, experience and learning from the private-sector to going further and faster together in the delivery of reliable, affordable, modern and sustainable energy for refugees.</p> <p><br></p> </div>","/Users/benrobinson/Zotero/storage/7FH2Q2CQ/Rosenberg-Jansen et al. - 2019 - Inclusive energy solutions in refugee camps.pdf","","PROJECT STEP: Design; USEFUL FOR: UN/INGO; USEFUL FOR: NGO/Other; USEFUL FOR: Policy/Governments; CO-DESIGN LEVEL: 2; USEFUL FOR: Community; ACCESS: Open Access; THEME: Gender, Disability, & Inclusion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

National coordination models are presented as an effective way to achieve this alignment, with the paper highlighting two examples from Jordan and Kenya, which illustrate the potential for sustainable energy solutions when displaced populations are included in national or sub-national development planning. The paper also identifies the need for partnerships with the private sector, given the insufficient public funds for the growing humanitarian crisis. However, there is little to no guidance on how to effectively operationalize private sector engagements between humanitarian organizations, development actors, host governments, and the private sector.

Clean cooking is being elevated to a higher priority on the policy agenda; better definitions and in-depth data and research tools are making it possible to understand households’ cooking energy needs and sector dynamics; and technological advances, aided by new payment and financ- ing approaches, are putting modern-energy cooking solutions within reach of many more low-income households. At the same time, impact-driven forms of finance are gaining ground as a way to pay for the expected public-goods benefits from clean cooking interven- tions. The World Bank’s Clean Cooking Fund—the largest dedicated fund for galvanizing political commitment, scaling up public and private investment, and catalyzing innovation— is using innovative Results-Based Financing (RBF) designs and applications to promote long-term market development and advance access for all. Lessons and success stories from the World Bank’s recent operational experience in the sector show how making access to clean cooking a political priority, using people-centered approaches, can drive large development impacts for society. To unlock a country’s clean cooking pathways, stakeholders must carefully consider its overall enabling environment, including its institutional capacity to implement transformative solutions. In countries with a high access deficit, addressing the cooking poverty issue will initially require modernizing the biomass fuel sector and promoting integrated, cost-effective approaches. The Clean Cooking Fund’s first IDA co-financed project in Rwanda offers a promising example of how a pro-poor approach can be used to fill the affordability gap and incentivize local stove design and technology innovation.","2023","2023-05-01 09:47:13","2023-10-03 07:48:00","2023-04-04 06:25:19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p>This report provides an overview of key challenges in creating and implementing market based project and programs for clean cooking.

The approach then utilizes a series of participatory tools, such as transect walks and mapping exercises, to help communities identify areas where open defecation is most common and to develop their own plans for constructing toilets and promoting better hygiene practices.</p> <p>CLTS has been adopted in many countries around the world and has been credited with significant improvements in sanitation and hygiene, particularly in rural areas. The approach is based on the principles of community participation, empowerment, and ownership, and it has been recognized as an effective and sustainable approach to promoting sanitation and hygiene at the community level.</p> <p>CTLS has the potential to be applied to the humanitarian setting and has significant value to the energy sector - especially when it comes to clean cooking.</p> </div>","","","PROJECT STEP: Design; USEFUL FOR: UN/INGO; USEFUL FOR: NGO/Other; PROJECT STEP: Needs Assessment; USEFUL FOR: Community; ACCESS: Open Access; TOOLS: Behaviour Change Approaches","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The instrument assesses the extent to which respondents describe stakeholder participation in each of the scope, design, and deliver phases of the design process, with co-design experts taking a collaborative approach throughout.

This study addresses the knowledge gap by acquiring primary data from two neighboring refugee settlements, Ayilo I and Ayilo II, in Northern Uganda. A mixed-methods approach obtained data on energy supply and use for households, small- to medium-sized enterprises, and public services. Reduced fuelwood availability in one settlement decreased household wood use by 23.4% relative to the adjacent set­ tlement, and led to households spending an average of 121.8% and 33.5% more per month to purchase wood and charcoal, respectively. Findings indicate current short-term energy decisions are unsustainable and that a move towards using alternative thermal energy sources is needed to reduce the deforestation and lessen tensions with host populations. The study also identifies electricity use in households that primarily consists of cellphones, lighting, and radios, that are best served by solar home systems or charging stations. Electricity demand from small- to medium-sized enterprises is rising to follow aspirations of business owners to expand services offered, whereas energy demand from public services is high with some issues in the reliability of existing power infrastructure. Findings also suggest that hybrid mini-grids can meet the growing demand of small- to mediumsized enterprises, provide reliable power to critical public services, and accommodate for the growth in elec­ tricity demand for refugee settings transitioning from temporary, semi-permanent, to permanent settlements.","2021-08","2023-05-10 07:39:05","2023-10-03 07:56:55","2023-05-10 07:38:59","102103","","","78","","Energy Research & Social Science","Refugee settlements in transition","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/benrobinson/Zotero/storage/MZ5ZNAPN/Van Hove and Johnson - 2021 - Refugee settlements in transition Energy access a.pdf","","PROJECT STEP: Design; USEFUL FOR: UN/INGO; USEFUL FOR: Policy/Governments; USEFUL FOR: Private Sector; ACCESS: Open Access; TOOLS: Technical Approaches","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many technologies or technology-based solutions fail to create a change or an impact on the beneficiaries due to various reasons. One of the prominent reasons being the lack of ability to engage the community in designing the solution. This paper discusses in detail the co-design methodology that was used to design and develop an innovative and acceptable cooking stove for a rural community in Odisha. The workshop on co-design was conducted as part of the experiential learning program called Live-in-Labs®. In this process, the interdisciplinary team of students along with the village women collaboratively engaged in the design process. The preparation, plan, and implementation of a co-design workshop for design and development of an improved cook stove is presented in this paper. The workshop, which spanned for 4 days, enabled an effective user acceptance of the designer intervention. We have recorded the tools and methodologies we used that is discussed in detail here. The paper also captures the interactions among the designers and users where large disparity in terms of knowledge, language, gender and age was observed. The observed favorable and unfavorable factors are discussed in detail. We found that the level of engagement is directly proportional to the level of ownership (of the mutually developed solution) by the community, thus ensuring sustainability.","2019-11","2023-05-03 12:07:16","2023-10-03 07:58:46","","153-158","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","ISSN: 2572-7621","","","","PROJECT STEP: Design; CO-DESIGN LEVEL: 1; CASE STUDY LEVEL: Community; CASE STUDY LEVEL: Household; CASE STUDY TECH: Cooking; CASE STUDY THEME: Gender, Disability, & Inclusion; CASE STUDY GROUP: Other; ACCESS: Open Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2019 IEEE R10 Humanitarian Technology Conference (R10-HTC)(47129)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since 2014, energy issues have been incorporated in the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) global protection strategies. Off-grid solar photovoltaic (PV) power solutions can now provide cost-effective clean electricity in camps comprising large populations of internally displaced people and/or refugees. Through microgrid modelling and risk analysis, business models that could provide affordable and appropriate energy to displaced communities are outlined in this paper. The proposed PV microgrid build-own-operate (BOO) business models for camps of displaced populations consider providing for household and institutional demands, and a combination of the two. It is concluded that sustainable energy services can be provided to humanitarian agencies to power their compounds and community services such as health clinics and administrative centres. A fixed tariff of US$1/kWh is viable provided: the local fuel prices are greater than US$0.6/L at the point of use, and the capital costs of a backup or existing diesel generator are already covered. A fixed price tariff mitigates running costs for humanitarian agencies. In addition, by leveraging the institutional energy demands, basic electricity services to up to 500 households for mobile phone charging and lighting could be provided for a monthly tariff of US$1.5 per household, which is favourable compared to the estimated of US$4 monthly cost of kerosene for a typical displaced person’s household. The proposed solution will reduce costs and improve the sustainability of humanitarian operations while achieving the UNHCR goals by providing electricity to displaced persons for lighting and communications.","2017","2023-05-11 07:20:52","2023-10-03 07:56:52","","","","2","5","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/benrobinson/Zotero/storage/H2FH4QE6/Cerrada - Photovoltaic Microgrid Business Models for Energy .pdf","","PROJECT STEP: Design; USEFUL FOR: UN/INGO; USEFUL FOR: Policy/Governments; USEFUL FOR: Private Sector; ACCESS: Open Access; TOOLS: Technical Approaches","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESCRIPTION: The Best Babies Zone (BBZ) initiative is a multi-year project aimed at reducing inequities in infant mortality rates. In 2012, BBZ launched pilot programs in three US cities: Cincinnati, Ohio; New Orleans, Louisiana; and Oakland, California. The Alameda County Public Health Department (ACPHD), the lead for the Oakland BBZ site, identified HCD as a promising approach for addressing the social and economic conditions that are important drivers of health inequities. HCD is a process for creating innovative products, services, and strategies that prioritizes the needs of the intended population. ACPHD partnered with the Gobee Group (a social innovation design consultancy) to develop the Design Sprint. The Design Sprint was a 12-week pilot in which 14 professionals from nine organizations used the HCD process to develop concepts for stimulating a vibrant local economy in the Oakland Best Babies Zone. ASSESSMENT: Thirty- to sixty-minute semi-structured interviews were conducted with all 14 individuals involved in the Design Sprint. With the exception of one interview, the interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and inductively coded to identify themes. CONCLUSION: Our experience suggests that HCD can: enhance community engagement; expedite the timeframe for challenge identification, program design, and implementation; and create innovative programs that address complex challenges.","2015-12","2023-05-12 04:35:21","2023-10-03 07:53:26","","2552-2559","","12","19","","Matern Child Health J","Human-Centered Design as an Approach for Place-Based Innovation in Public Health","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 26197732","","","","PROJECT STEP: Design; USEFUL FOR: UN/INGO; USEFUL FOR: NGO/Other; PROJECT STEP: Needs Assessment; PROJECT STEP: Stakholder Mapping; ACCESS: Institutional Access; TOOLS: HCD & Design Thinking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We studied how public acceptability is influenced by people’s trust in agents responsible for renewable energy projects and the influence that people have over decisions regarding these projects. As expected, higher trust and having influence over major decisions regarding the project led to higher project acceptability. Public acceptability was lowest when people had low trust in responsible agents and when people could only influence minor decisions regarding the project.

One of the key aspects of co-design is the involvement of key stakeholders including the private sector, which missed in the trends of energy access in humanitarian settings. This is due to the lack of an enabling environment and encouragement mechanisms for the private sector to be involved. To have a complete and successful co-design in humanitarian settings creating an enabling environment that attracts the contribution of every potential stakeholder is essential. With this regard, this report discusses policies and strategies required to encourage private-sector participation and involvement in humanitarian energy interventions/projects related to finance, where it proposes innovative financing mechanisms. On the other hand, this report gives insights on how to incorporate financing mechanisms in the co-design process. The report underscores the importance of co-design principles in humanitarian settings, particularly regarding financial mechanisms for private-sector involvement in energy interventions. By incorporating stakeholder collaboration, considering project-specific risks, and exploring innovative financing structures, it aims to address the unique challenges faced in displacement settings and ultimately contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goal 7.</p> <p style=""text-align: justify"" dir=""ltr"">This report provides an overview of the financial mechanisms required to encourage private-sector participation in humanitarian energy interventions. These interventions are necessary to meet Sustainable Development Goal 7 by 2030, particularly in displacement settings where there are unique challenges that inhibit the uptake of cleaner energy solutions. Traditional financing approaches may not work in such an underdeveloped market, so alternative structures are needed, such as blended financial instruments. These structures should be specific to the risk and type of project and can include grants, results-based financing, and impact bonds. Displacement settings represent a complex and unpredictable operating environment, requiring not just smart mobilization of financing but also policy and technical interventions to create a more enabling environment for donors, NGOs, the private sector, and potential investors. The authors recommended exploring specific productive and public energy projects coupled with technical assistance to support market data, pipeline development, and project implementation is necessary. They also suggested that researching the merits of a global pooled facility versus more localized and project-specific approaches, and the creation of a dedicated group to aggregate projects across humanitarian settings is essential.</p> <p><br></p> </div>","/Users/benrobinson/Zotero/storage/85T8GSI9/Cohen and Patel - 2019 - Innovative Financing  for Humanitarian Energy  Int.pdf","","USEFUL FOR: UN/INGO; USEFUL FOR: NGO/Other; USEFUL FOR: Policy/Governments; USEFUL FOR: Private Sector; PROJECT STEP: Implementation; THEME: Systems Approaches to Energy Access; CO-DESIGN LEVEL: 2; BASIC RESOURCE; ACCESS: Open Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, 40% of the global population do not have access to sustainable energy sources, and instead rely on burning biomass to satisfy their energy needs. Despite a long history of energy technology for poverty-alleviation initiatives across the globe, many interventions fail at persuading end-users to continue using these technologies beyond an initial adoption phase. Whilst many champion sustainable energy solutions, most evaluation approaches do not consider long term sustained use. As a result, many end-user-orientated energy solutions, such as Improved Cookstoves (ICS), fall out of use once project partners depart. These failures are often due to emphasis on ever-more-complex technologies rather than social methodologies such as understanding end-user priorities and the complex contextual barriers to sustained use. In this paper, we present a novel interdisciplinary formative and evaluative implementation or delivery model, the qualitative Technology Implementation Model for Energy (TIME), for practitioners and policymakers. TIME focuses on refining three core areas of energy technology implementation; to rethink how impact is defined, to understand differences between practitioner perception and end-user reality, and to champion a co-produced approach with all key stakeholders in the energy system.

The research presented here was generated by an interdisciplinary research team made up of partners in Kenya, Uganda and South Africa. The research partners set out to better understand how sustainable energy transitions can be achieved through collaborative efforts between community members, experts and policy actors in the three countries. This paper provides evidence-based reflections on how the research partners used participatory methods to facilitate solution co-design and knowledge co-production over a period of two years under the Leading Integrated Research for Agenda 2030 in Africa (LIRA 2030) program. A key knowledge outcome of the research partnership is an improved understanding of how transdisciplinary research across the sub-region can be used to unearth the socio-spatial, cultural and political dimensions of energy in relation to other urban services such as health and housing.

By incorporating various sustainability aspects and existing planning tools, as well as promoting co-design principles, inclusivity and energy access can be improved. It illustrates the practical application and potential of co-design in humanitarian settings by implementing the framework in the design of a solar mini grid in Djibouti's Holl Holl refugee camp. This approach encourages active participation from all stakeholders, including the displaced community, humanitarian practitioners, and local partners, in the planning and design process. By involving these stakeholders, the energy interventions can effectively address the specific needs and preferences of the camp's residents. The framework combines sustainability considerations with co-design principles, enabling the creation of sustainable interventions and business models that align with the local context. It challenges the prevailing sectoral and short-term thinking within the humanitarian sector, prioritizing long-term sustainability and empowering the displaced population. Generally, the study presents a roadmap for integrating co-design principles into the planning and design of energy access interventions in humanitarian settings.

Instead, the Do No Harm principle should lead humanitarian aid agencies to make an active effort to accept responsibility for the harm while taking all necessary steps to mitigate or avoid harming in future interventions.","2021-03-08","2023-06-05 10:50:38","2023-10-03 07:46:57","","7","","1","6","","Journal of International Humanitarian Action","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","/Users/benrobinson/Zotero/storage/Q7WDCKYX/Khaled - 2021 - Do No Harm in refugee humanitarian aid the case o.pdf","","USEFUL FOR: UN/INGO; USEFUL FOR: NGO/Other; PROJECT STEP: Implementation; PROJECT STEP: M&E; CO-DESIGN LEVEL: 2; ACCESS: Open Access; THEME: Humanitarian Principles?","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But unlike oil, data are not a substance found in nature. It must be appropriated. The capture and processing of social data unfolds through a process we call data relations, which ensures the “natural” conversion of daily life into a data stream. The result is nothing less than a new social order, based on continuous tracking, and offering unprecedented new opportunities for social discrimination and behavioral influence. We propose that this process is best understood through the history of colonialism. Thus, data relations enact a new form of data colonialism, normalizing the exploitation of human beings through data, just as historic colonialism appropriated territory and resources and ruled subjects for profit. Data colonialism paves the way for a new stage of capitalism whose outlines we only glimpse: the capitalization of life without limit.","2018-07-28","2023-06-20 04:15:43","2023-10-03 07:45:34","","","","","20","","Television & New Media","Data Colonialism","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","/Users/benrobinson/Zotero/storage/9P94SPRX/Couldry and Mejias - 2018 - Data Colonialism Rethinking Big Data’s Relation t.pdf","","PROJECT STEP: Design; USEFUL FOR: UN/INGO; USEFUL FOR: Policy/Governments; THEME: Decolonisation; CO-DESIGN LEVEL: 3; ACCESS: Open Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
