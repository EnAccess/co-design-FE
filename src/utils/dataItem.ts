    title: "Scale & Replicability",
    description:
      "Whilst the idea of replicability (the ability to copy and paste using the same resources) is embedded in many humanitarian organisations, true scalability is often reserved for the private sector - how can the two learn from each other to create more effective and efficient humanitarian programs?",

    title: "Localisation",

    title: "Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning",
    description:
      "AI can be leveraged to create content to amplify local voices, navigating complex funding mazes, and minimising legal and administration costs that slow action - but it cannot replace human interaction or trusting partnerships.",
