    "Abstract Note": "The increasing number of displaced people in the world not only requires rapid humanitarian actions, but also attention to host communities and a holistic and long-term vision. Energy has not been really considered a major topic in people displacement, yet, resulting in negative impacts on several aspects, including food security. New solutions are required, in terms of energy planning, technology development, and adaptation, as well as decision making, sensitization, training, and support to humanitarian actors. The Sustainable Energy Technologies for food security (SET4food) project phase 1 (2014–2015) developed a number of tools to support identification, adaptation, and introduction of appropriate solutions, tested some pilot innovations in critical areas, and promoted the enhancement of humanitarian response capability in the energy sector via an extensive capacity building program. In addition, a second phase of the project (2015–2018) fostered networking and collaboration between the main actors by developing an e-sharing platform, called ENERGYCoP, including a global not-for-profit community of practices for humanitarian professionals working in the energy sector. The platform may enable the shift from traditional “technological transfer” to a more participative approach on co-design and technological cooperation activated by a knowledge sharing mechanism. This paper outlines the main challenges and the achieved results of SET4food, providing recommendations for researchers and practitioners on the way forward.",

    "Abstract Note": "This report aims to explore how HEED approached and delivered capacity building for the research team, project partners and the communities the team worked within Rwanda and Nepal. This report's purpose is threefold: first, to be evidential on how HEED planned, delivered and captured impact around capacity building so similar projects can develop best practice when skills development is a key deliverable. Second, to encourage other energy projects to document the impact produced by researchers and practitioners' involvement while working with communities. Therefore, to recognise the tacit and dynamic aspects of knowledge production, not only the more explicit aspects. Third, suggest recommendations to support a skills-led approach to capacity building that provides personal and professional development opportunities to deepen knowledge production and impact.",

    "Abstract Note": "The paper presents evidence from the performance assessment of two solar energy interventions. Specifically, an evidence base was built around two community co-conceived standalone photovoltaic-battery systems, which were deployed in two refugee camps in Rwanda. We found that for both installations (a micro-grid and a community hall electrification system) energy consumption levels were low, showing that sizeable energy consumption gaps can still develop when co-conceived interventions are deployed. The consumption gap led to low performance ratios (33% and 25% respectively for the micro-grid and community hall system). To guide further work and improve the sustainability of community interventions, we draw a number of design principles for future energy interventions in similar contexts. To deliver sustainable energy transitions for refugees, there needs to be a move towards co-creating community interventions that promote self-governance to position communities as users, maintainers and suppliers of energy services, throughout an intervention's lifetime.",

    "Abstract Note": "The energy justice literature has seen a rapid surge in both academic and practical popularity. However, there has been less systematic reflection on the research conducted so far, its scope or contribution, nor what it might mean for the future of the concept. To provide insights, this paper presents the results of a systematic and comprehensive review of 155 peer-reviewed articles published across eight databases between January 2008 and December 2019. The aim is firstly to review the current state of the art in the energy justice literature and, secondly, to present findings that support novel recommendations with the potential to enhance the impact of energy justice research, including applications in the economic and planning policy sectors. Critically, our study demonstrates that the literature lacks diversity in its author basis and research design. By contrast, conceptual frameworks and the geographies and technologies of global energy injustice are proliferating. These results illustrate that energy justice has power and agency as a tool. It can act as a protagonist in energy research, provoking researchers to remain reflexively normative and active in identifying injustices and vulnerabilities, and it can act as a promising progenitor, creating new research methods and themes.",

The document defines energy justice as the equitable distribution of benefits and harms associated with energy production and consumption, and identifies several key themes that have emerged in energy justice research, including access to energy, energy affordability, and environmental justice. It discusses the various methodologies used to study energy justice, such as quantitative and qualitative approaches, and highlights the importance of interdisciplinary and participatory research. The document also examines the geographical scope of energy justice research, with a focus on both developed and developing countries, and discusses the ways in which energy justice intersects with issues of race, class, and gender. It further explores the role of technology in energy justice, including both the potential benefits and drawbacks of various energy technologies. The document ultimately argues for a more comprehensive and integrated approach to energy justice research that takes into account the multiple dimensions and complexities of this field.</p> <p>Energy justice is a topic that humanitarian energy practitioners have little engagement with. Whilst it shared similarities with the “do no harm” approach, conceptualizations of energy justice step past this minimum standard approach to embrace the complexities of complex problems in the context of energy justice. This also links into knowledge hierarchies and concepts of knowledge/knowing which are dominated by global north institutions - understandings of justice from alternative knowledge centers are key for effective and meaningful knowledge sharing (and thus co-design methodologies)</p> </div>",

    "Abstract Note": "Refugee camps are among the most prevalent institutional responses to global displacement. Despite a quasi consensus among scholars, activists, and humanitarians that camps are undesirable, and should only ever be temporary, little work has charted the political project and practices of camp abolition that challenge their spatial unfreedom. Rather than life-supporting spatial technologies of care that unwittingly signal political failures of inclusion, camps form part of a calculated system of “carceral humanitarianism”. This article draws on experiences from Kenya where aid interventions have shaped politics, social dynamics and economic life since the 1990s. Kakuma camp and Kalobeyei settlement serve as empirical windows to explore the limits of institutional decampment and reform policies, while demonstrating that more radical, abolitionist struggles are enacted through everyday mobilisation and acts of fugitivity among refugees themselves. Advancing critical studies of humanitarianism and forced migration, this article contends that only abolishing camps and their carceral logics helps to build more viable, safe, and humane futures for people on the move.",

The document examines the discourse of humanitarian innovation from a postcolonial perspective, highlighting the power dynamics and underlying assumptions that shape the way innovation is conceived and implemented in the humanitarian sector. It argues that the dominant discourse of humanitarian innovation often reflects a Western-centric, technocratic approach that fails to adequately engage with local knowledge, needs, and capacities. The document presents the findings of a community-led innovation partnership that sought to challenge this dominant discourse by involving affected communities in the innovation process. It discusses the challenges and opportunities of this approach and emphasizes the importance of centering the perspectives and agency of affected communities in humanitarian innovation. The document ultimately calls for a more critical and reflexive approach to humanitarian innovation that recognizes the complexity and diversity of contexts and perspectives in which it operates.</p> </div>",

    "Abstract Note": "Also referred to as ‘community mapping’, it is based on the premise that local inhabitants hold accurate knowledge of their customary (and otherwise usually unrecorded) tenure of forests, as well as expert knowledge of their local environments which can be expressed in maps which are easily understandable. Maps created by local communities represent the place in which they live, showing features communities themselves perceive as important such as customary land boundaries, how they use the forest, sacred areas, and so on. The process used to create participatory maps can be very valuable in itself. They are planned around a common community goal and should be made with input from an entire community. The result is a product that represents the knowledge of the entire community. Participatory mapping can use a variety of different techniques, ranging from ‘earth maps’ (usually a drawing in sand in a communal space in a village) to sophisticated digital maps using a GIS (geographic information system). Where the maps are intended to inform outside groups, they follow recognised cartographic conventions. It is a powerful tool that allows remote and marginalised communities to represent themselves spatially, bringing their local knowledge and perspectives to the attention of governmental authorities and decision-makers.",

    "Abstract Note": "The Partnership Co-design Toolkit (P.ACT), the result of a collaboration between MIT D-Lab and SEED through a year-long joint learning lab, seeks to tackle this challenge and offers a disciplined, inclusive, and practical approach to co-creating better value chain partnerships. Collaboration between impact entrepreneurs and large corporate, government, or development actors holds the promise of scaling key innovations, yet these hybrid partnerships are difficult to forge, and many often fail due to uneven foundations. This toolkit is targeted towards impact entrepreneurs, intrapreneurs, partnership brokers and facilitators, and accelerators supporting impact entrepreneurs who are initiating value chain partnerships, partnerships where organizations seek to integrate existing or create new value chains to bring these innovations to market. Designed to maximize partnership success, P.ACT offers four unique features: Co-design process: A four stage co-design framework to ensure inclusive participation and continuous engagement of all partners. Value focus: Emphasis on defining both the value created and the value captured through the partnership. It focuses the partners' attention on generating value for their customers and beneficiaries as well as for their organizations. Collaborative approach: Individual self-assessment and reflection alongside collective problem solving, constructive dialogue, decision making, and action planning. Modular use: Enabling users to diagnose their partnership needs and helps them identify the right tools to move their partnership forward.",

    "Abstract Note": "There is a paucity of data on energy access in refugee camps and limited analysis regarding the viability of modern energy technologies such as solar home systems in these contexts. This paper addresses these by presenting an overview of the household and small enterprise electricity access situation in Kigeme, Nyabiheke and Gihembe camps in Rwanda and through the application of a Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal and Environmental (PESTLE) analysis to assess the barriers influencing solar home system provision. Most households and small enterprises currently have limited or no access to electricity and there is significant unmet demand for energy services such as mobile phone charging, lighting, and entertainment in the camps. The analysis suggests that solar home systems can meet these energy needs and identifies important factors in ensuring projects are successful. Projects should be informed by the needs and priorities of end-users and should be aligned with national policies, such as achieving Tier 2 energy access, to garner political support. Where possible, local market systems should be nurtured to normalise paying for energy products and to avoid free distribution. This can support private sector engagement and result in longer system lifetimes through improved maintenance. Energy literacy programmes can also improve awareness of solar home systems and their benefits compared to traditional sources of energy. These findings can inform practitioners on the supporting policy/financial frameworks, design requirements and implementation measures needed to maximise the benefits of future solar home system projects and help achieve electrification targets.",

Breaking this impasse requires transformative public- and private-sector solutions and large-scale investments that can improve the overall cooking ecosystem with end users’ needs at the centre. Recent trends in designing more effective solutions are gaining momentum. By working together with a ‘heart-head-and-hands approach’, stakeholders can move the needle forward on clean cooking, and in the process, contribute to the SDGs for health and well-being, women’s empowerment, and a cleaner environment.",

    "Abstract Note": "There is a pressing need for innovation in the humanitarian sector, faced as it is with ever-growing demands for it to respond to the plight of people affected by both human and natural disasters. These are arguably growing in scale, scope, and complexity, and look likely to continue to do so. However, despite being referred to more explicitly in the last ten years, the understanding of humanitarian innovation by practitioners, policymakers, and academics is still very much in its infancy. To help address this issue, this paper drawn on and extends the innovation ecosystems literature to present a systematic framework for analysing innovation in the humanitarian sector. This framework is illustrated using evidence from an interview-based survey of ‘informed’ users and a set of in-depth case studies.",

The theory suggests that behavior is not only influenced by individual characteristics such as personality and attitudes, but also by the context in which it occurs.</p> <p>According to the theory, behavior is influenced by three components of the behavioral setting: physical, social, and organizational. The physical component includes the physical environment in which behavior occurs, such as the layout of a room or the design of a building. The social component refers to the social context in which behavior occurs, such as the presence or absence of other people and the norms and expectations that govern behavior. The organizational component refers to the rules, regulations, and policies that govern behavior.</p> <p>The theory also suggests that behavior is influenced by the fit between the individual and the behavioral setting. A good fit between the individual and the setting results in behavior that is consistent with the setting's goals and expectations, while a poor fit can lead to noncompliance and even counterproductive behavior.</p> <p>Behavioral settings theory has been applied in a variety of settings, such as schools, hospitals, and workplaces, to understand and improve behavior. The theory suggests that interventions that modify the physical, social, or organizational components of a behavioral setting can lead to changes in behavior.</p> </div>",

    "Abstract Note": "This paper highlights some of the central ethical challenges involved in undertaking social science research with refugees in conflict and crisis situations. It focuses on two main sets of challenges: first, the difficulties of constructing an ethical consent process and obtaining genuinely informed consent; and second, taking fully into account and responding to refugee participants' capacities for autonomy. The authors also discuss the challenges involved in applying the central normative principles governing ethics review processes—the principles of beneficence, integrity, respect for persons, autonomy and justice—to the context of refugee research. It is argued that researchers should seek ways to move beyond harm minimization as a standard for ethical research and recognize an obligation to design and conduct research projects that aim to bring about reciprocal benefits for refugee participants and/or communities. Some of the methodological issues raised by this analysis are discussed in the conclusion.",

It highlights the health, environmental, and economic impacts of cooking with traditional fuels, such as firewood and charcoal, which are often the only options available in these settings. The document also presents some of the innovative market based solutions that are being developed to address these challenges across the clean cooking, solar cooking, and biogas sectors. The authors argue that there “is significant potential for private-sector engagement in this context – which, though largely overlooked to date, could result in win-win scenarios for all stakeholders”.</p> <p>This document draws on a number of case studies from the Moving Energy Initiative.</p> </div>",

    "Abstract Note": "More than 40% of the world’s population still relies on traditional biomass for their cooking needs. A shift to advanced cookstoves can bring significant health and environmental benefits, but only with near exclusive use which requires significant changes in users’ behaviours. Since the emergence of the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves (now the Clean Cooking Alliance) in 2011, more attention has been directed to consumer and demand side factors in clean cookstove adoption and efforts to better understand individuals’ behaviours, household dynamics and decision making around the adoption of clean cookstoves and fuels have increased. This paper presents a review of the academic literature (2013–2020) and aims to identify the most successful interventions of behaviour change techniques in the adoption of improved cookstoves as well as the most common barriers to success cited in the literature. The study sourced 40 peer reviewed published academic papers from spring 2013 to summer 2020, and identified the following most commonly used behaviour change techniques in the adoption of improved cookstoves: Shaping Knowledge (n = 19), Reward & Threat (n = 13), Social Support (n = 9), Comparisons (n = 4), Identity/Self-Belief (n = 4), Regulation (n = 0), Change in the Physical Environment (n = 2), Goals & Planning (n = 6). Based on these results, we present gaps in the literature and provide policy recommendations to promote the adoption and continued use of improved cookstoves.",

    "Notes": "<div data-schema-version=\"8\"><p>The document titled \"Energy and Displacement: 8 Objects, 8 Stories\" is a report by the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) program at Chatham House. The report highlights the impact of energy projects on displacement in the MENA region. It presents eight case studies from different countries, demonstrating how energy infrastructure projects have led to forced displacement of local communities. The report identifies a lack of consideration for social and environmental impacts in energy projects and calls for more responsible and sustainable energy development practices that prioritize the well-being of affected communities.</p> <p>These are the key takeaways:</p> <ul> <li> Taking people’s existing knowledge and energy practices into account would, one<br>might expect, already be central to the design of humanitarian interventions. Yet dominant approaches to energy access continue to marginalize questions about what people actually use energy for in daily life. </li> <li> People’s resourcefulness in providing for their energy needs in both camps demonstrates the opposite of a culture of dependency. </li> <li> Humanitarian energy interventions need to address ‘end of life’ issues for technology, equipment and materials. </li> <li> Labelling conventional fuels and energy practices as ‘dirty’ or, worse, ‘primitive’ clouds the understanding of the social and cultural significance that underpin them. </li> </ul> </div>",

    "Notes": "<div data-schema-version=\"8\"><p>The article highlights the importance of analytical decision tools and methods in the energy sector for sustainable operations and developments. However, it notes that energy decision-making in the context of protracted and displaced settlements is largely unexplored. Energy decision-making involves evaluating social, technical, environmental, and economic criteria, but there may be a lack of information regarding the energy needs and aspirations of different communities. The additional complexities and challenges of managing energy provision in refugee camps and settlements require decision support tools to provide a more systematic and objective assessment of the factors that should inform energy provision in contexts of displacement.</p> <p>This paper presents the the Renewable Energy Recommendation (RERT) tool. RERT is a decision support tool developed to assist stakeholders in making informed decisions about renewable energy projects. The tool takes into account a range of criteria, including technical feasibility, economic viability, environmental sustainability, and social impact.</p> <p>RERT uses a multi-criteria decision analysis approach that considers the preferences and priorities of different stakeholders, as well as the potential trade-offs between different criteria. The tool generates a set of recommended renewable energy options based on the input of stakeholders and the criteria considered.</p> <p>RERT is designed to be flexible and adaptable to different contexts, including rural and urban areas, and can be used at different stages of the project development cycle. The tool can be used by a range of stakeholders, including governments, NGOs, and community organizations, to identify and evaluate renewable energy options that meet their specific needs and goals.</p> </div>",

The use of new communications and database technologies in LMICs is generating ‘big data’ (for example from the use of mobile phones, mobile-based financial services and the internet) which is collected and processed by corporations. When shared, these data are also becoming a potentially valuable resource for development research and policy. With these new sources of data, new power structures are emerging within the field of development. We identify two trends in particular, illustrating them with examples: first, the empowerment of public–private partnerships around datafication in LMICs and the consequently growing agency of corporations as development actors. Second, the way commercially generated big data is becoming the foundation for country-level ‘data doubles’, i.e. digital representations of social phenomena and/or territories that are created in parallel with, and sometimes in lieu of, national data and statistics. We explore the resulting shift from legibility (Scott, 1998) to visibility, and the implications of seeing development interventions as a byproduct of larger-scale processes of informational capitalism.",

    "Abstract Note": "In long-term emergency operations such as refugee camps, humanitarian aid faces logistical and budgetary limitations. Thus far, the energy systems that supply these operations are designed with little insight on demand needs, leading to the deployment of standardized fossil-dependent solutions which, albeit presenting low investment costs, are pollutant and often inefficient. This work applies a multi-disciplinary methodology to develop an energy demand modelling framework for Tier 0 refugee camps, and assesses the implementation of alternative power supply systems. It does so by not only focusing on its techno-economic feasibility, but equally through investigating the challenges on adoption in the specific context of refugee camps, by undertaking interviews with relevant stakeholders in the humanitarian sector. The modelling application has been performed for the Mantapala refugee camp, in Zambia, enabling the comparison of different combinations of power supply systems against current diesel-based solutions, using HOMER software. Results show that the implementation of hybrid renewable energy systems is viable, both technically and economically, with energy costs being reduced up to 50%, with paybacks lower than five years. However, from the interviews performed, some non-technical constraints that may hinder the adoption of these systems in refugee camps were identified, such as uncertainty, lack of funding and difficulties on risk-sharing collaborations. As such, a discussion focused on possible strategies that may help overcome these barriers is presented.",

    "Notes": "<div data-schema-version=\"8\"><p>Considering the technological solutions is also another aspect of co-design. This paper argues that a multidisciplinary approach is necessary to develop an energy demand modeling framework and assess the implementation of alternative power supply systems (including techno- economic analysis and discussing the challenges and barriers to adoption in the specific context) to have sustainable and inclusive energy solutions in humanitarian settings. Specific context here is a critical variable, where in co-design process considering a specific local context could make the co-design process and implementation sustainable and effective.&nbsp;</p> <p>The paper discusses the challenges faced in providing sustainable energy solutions in refugee camps, where standardized fossil-dependent solutions are mostly used. The authors propose a multi-disciplinary methodology to develop an energy demand modeling framework for refugee camps with Tier 0 and assess the implementation of alternative power supply systems (including techno- economic analysis and discussing the challenges and barriers to adoption in the specific context). The modeling is performed for Mantapala refugee camp in Zambia using HOMER software. Results indicate that implementing hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) is viable techno-economically, reducing energy costs up to half with paybacks lower than five years. However, non-technical constraints such as uncertainty, lack of funding, and difficulties in risk-sharing collaborations may hinder the adoption of these systems. The study highlights the importance of accurate information on energy demand needs and the inefficiency of current power supply solutions found in refugee camps, and proposes a more sustainable and cost-effective approach, which is relevant to humanitarian aid organizations seeking to improve the sustainability of energy systems in displaced settings. The authors concluded that implementing HRES in refugee camps is feasible and can bring significant CO2 emissions savings, but requires organizational changes, such as developing tailored business models for HRES in refugee camps.</p> </div>",

It presents the findings of a research project that involved interviews with individuals who have been displaced due to energy-related projects in different parts of the world. The document discusses the negative impacts of displacement on individuals' lives, including loss of livelihoods, social disruption, and psychological distress. It also highlights the ways in which energy projects can exacerbate existing inequalities and lead to further marginalization of displaced communities. The document emphasizes the need for energy companies and policymakers to take into account the lived experiences of displaced communities and to prioritize the protection of their human rights. It calls for a more participatory and community-centered approach to energy development that respects the rights and needs of affected communities.</p> </div>",

    "Abstract Note": "The purpose of this paper is to shed light on how interventions designed to alleviate energy poverty within displacement settings may bring about adverse effects. Within the past 20 years, the topic of energy access has increasingly made its way into the humanitarian field. Despite the direction of this emerging niche, interventions rarely bring about its intended outcomes. Building on participant observations collected among a multitude of stakeholders and ethnographic data from the Ugandan refugee settlement Rhino Camp, the paper has two main aims. First, we draw into question reigning assumptions among energy stakeholders that often explain the slow progress toward increasing energy access within displacement settings by way of recipient’s cultural disposition and lack of knowledge. Second, advancing the concept of transactional communities encompassing refugees and hosts, this article contributes to critical studies on energy transitions by not only viewing cooking as an individual or cultural practice, but also a social practice built upon interdependency and reciprocity. Including the perspectives of both refugees and host communities serves to pre-empt the protracted situation of refugee settlements, stressing the importance of considering transactional parties as a more durable entity that transcends temporary and problematic notions of refugee and host.",

    "Abstract Note": "Our planet is currently in the midst of a global humanitarian crisis. Yet, there is a widening gap between over 80 million displaced people and the political will to meet their needs. Improving energy access in the displaced setting to build capacity and resilience requires meaningful integration of the needs of communities throughout the design, delivery and evaluation process within the socio-technical energy system. This paper aims to explore the ways in which co-design is conceptualised and applied, from an interdisciplinary perspective, within the socio-technical framing. We do this by first conducting a rapid review of relevant co-design literature to understand theories, typologies and identify methods of best co-design practice in the Humanitarian Energy sector. Second, we present the Humanitarian Engineering and Energy for Displacement project as a co-design case study for Humanitarian Energy using Technology Implementation Model for Energy (TIME) as a framework for analysis. Our rapid review resulted in the typology of the Spectrum of Co-Design, a mapping of differing conceptualisations of co-design showing their positioning and interactions. Our results show that by exploring if and how conceptual frameworks, such as TIME, adds value to practitioner orientated humanitarian programming this can make a significant contribution to future proofing energy systems that seek to deliver inclusive, sustainable and just transitions. We highlight specific learnings from HEED around the disconnection between perceptions of key stakeholder roles, misunderstandings of energy access and use, and building trusting partnerships through the creation of meaningful rectification pathways.",

From my search of resources on co-design in humanitarian energy context, this paper is the one I found that defines co-design in humanitarian energy context and gives a first insight in the spectrum of co-design.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\" dir=\"ltr\">This paper focuses on the importance of energy access for displaced communities and how co-design methods can be used in the humanitarian energy sector to integrate the needs of affected populations in the energy system design, delivery, and evaluation process. The authors conduct a rapid review of relevant literature and develop the Spectrum of Co-Design to map different conceptualizations of co-design and their interactions. The study presented the Humanitarian Engineering and Energy for Displacement (HEED) project as a co-design case study, which highlights the importance of building trusting partnerships through meaningful rectification pathways and addressing misconceptions of energy access and use. The study recommends developing new co-design methods to connect different sectors and future-proof energy systems, moving away from siloed sub-sectors of humanitarian energy. Utilizing co-design frameworks like TIME can aid in the co-production of energy programs with all key stakeholders involved and create trusting and equitable partnerships. However, the study emphasizes that acknowledging failures, iterative course correction, and developing a deep understanding of complex contextual factors are necessary for sustained impact in the humanitarian energy ecosystems. Overall, the paper stresses the need for co-design methods that prioritize the needs and perspectives of affected populations and foster collaborative partnerships across sectors to effectively address the lack of energy access in displaced communities.</p> <p><br></p> </div>",

The report identifies a range of factors that contribute to exclusion, including discriminatory policies and practices, lack of access to information, and limited opportunities for meaningful participation.</p> <p>The study also highlights the importance of taking a more context-specific approach to inclusion and exclusion, as different factors may be more or less relevant in different settings. The report suggests that humanitarian actors need to work more closely with forcibly displaced people and their communities to better understand their needs and preferences.</p> <p>The recommendations are:</p> <ul> <li> <span style=\"color: rgb(11.300000%, 11.200000%, 10.700000%)\">Adopt strong inclusion policies and inclusive humanitarian policies at global and organisational level. </span> </li> <li> <span style=\"color: rgb(11.300000%, 11.200000%, 10.700000%)\">Rebalance humanitarian responses towards quality and equity.</span> </li> <li> <span style=\"color: rgb(11.300000%, 11.200000%, 10.700000%)\">Adopt strategic indicators and approaches to operationalise impartiality in humanitarian responses through clear response-level strategies and definitions of success</span> </li> <li> <span style=\"color: rgb(11.300000%, 11.200000%, 10.700000%)\">Address the fragmented nature of inclusion through more intersectional approaches and greater collaboration by adopting more holistic and joined-up approaches to guidance, training and specialised programming; more collective work and advocacy around common challenges undermining inclusion</span> </li> <li> <span style=\"color: rgb(11.300000%, 11.200000%, 10.700000%)\">Ensure sufficient resources and capacity exist to support inclusion at an operational level through leadership-level commitments to mainstreaming inclusion within humanitarian organisations.</span> </li> <li> <span style=\"color: rgb(11.300000%, 11.200000%, 10.700000%)\">Inform inclusive responses by adopting a rights-based understanding of needs and vulnerabilities</span> </li> <li> <span style=\"color: rgb(11.300000%, 11.200000%, 10.700000%)\">Track exclusion in humanitarian response as part of a renewed commitment to effective impartiality.</span> </li> <li> <span style=\"color: rgb(11.300000%, 11.200000%, 10.700000%)\">Uphold participation and accountability as a right for all people in crisis.</span> </li> <li> <span style=\"color: rgb(11.300000%, 11.200000%, 10.700000%)\">Centre the role of local actors in supporting more inclusive responses </span> </li> <li> <span style=\"color: rgb(11.300000%, 11.200000%, 10.700000%)\">Strengthen links between humanitarian inclusion and the ‘nexus’.</span> </li> </ul> </div>",

The report highlights the good practices that have been adopted to promote inclusion, as well as the challenges and gaps that need to be addressed. The report argues that persons with disabilities are often left behind in humanitarian responses, despite being disproportionately affected by crises. It identifies several factors that contribute to this, including inaccessible infrastructure, lack of disability-specific data, and limited disability expertise among humanitarian actors. The report also provides recommendations for improving the inclusion of persons with disabilities, such as promoting disability-inclusive programming and investing in disability expertise. Overall, the report highlights the importance of addressing the needs and rights of persons with disabilities in humanitarian action to ensure that they are not left behind in times of crisis.</p> </div>",

In order to do so, it has surveyed a range of relevant literature from different disciplinary perspectives, most notably innovation theory, design theory, and participatory methods. In each case, it has highlighted the strengths and weaknesses in what these perspectives have to offer, integrating them as a way of beginning to think through a practical framework and research agenda through which to advance bottom-up humanitarian innovation that might be applied to the emergency phase, protracted crises, and recovery, in ways that draw directly upon the skills, aspirations, and entrepreneurship of so-called beneficiary communities.”</p> </div>",

    "Abstract Note": "This chapter seeks to highlight the role of refugees within innovation systems, specifically in informal sector innovation. Refugee communities are vibrant hotbeds of innovation, where migrants transfer knowledge and skills to new environments and entrepreneurship happens of necessity. Thus, there are many benefits that might flow to countries that embrace the innovative potential of refugees. At the same time, the world’s refugee population is growing faster than humanitarian aid’s capacity to keep up with the needs of refugees. To address this gap, the international community through policies such as the UN Global Compact for Refugees is calling for more sustainable solutions to ensure refugee self-reliance. Innovation and entrepreneurship in the informal sector is a promising path towards greater self-reliance. Countering the narrative that refugees are a drain on society, this chapter examines innovation by refugees in the informal sector in Uganda both within and outside of refugee camps. It showcases ways in which refugees have provided innovative solutions to community-faced problems that benefit both the host and refugee communities.",

It argues that formal economic structures often do not cater to the needs of refugees and their informal businesses. The document highlights several intermediaries that support informal economies, including microfinance institutions, social enterprises, and NGOs. It suggests that by supporting these intermediaries, policymakers can help to unlock the potential of refugee economies and create more sustainable and inclusive communities.</p> <p>These 5 actions are critical to engaging with informal systems:</p> <ol> <li> Supporting and investing in intermediaries that work with informal refugee businesses. </li> <li> Recognizing the importance of informal economies in refugee communities and creating policies that support their growth. </li> <li> Encouraging collaboration between formal and informal sectors to create more inclusive and sustainable economies. </li> <li> Investing in education and training programs that help refugees develop their skills and increase their economic opportunities. </li> <li> Conducting research to better understand the needs and challenges of informal economies in refugee communities. </li> </ol> </div>",

UNICEF wishes to acknowledge the contribution of all those that participated, and who share a passion for placing communities at the centre of development and humanitarian action. The consultation process consisted of a series of interviews, meetings and workshops over an 18‐month period. Representatives from countries in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, Europe and North America contributed input and feedback based on their experiences of designing, implementing and measuring community engagement approaches. Working groups from both the development and humanitarian spheres were established to support the lead consultants in their work; and while their individual names are not included here (and they are represented by their organizations below) UNICEF wishes to acknowledge their important contributions.",

The report identifies four main domains for ECD programs: health, nutrition, child protection, and early learning. Each domain is further broken down into standards and indicators, which are measurable goals that can be used to assess the quality of ECD programs. The report also provides guidance on how to implement and monitor these standards and indicators, as well as recommendations for improving ECD programs in humanitarian settings.

Numerous approaches are used to tackle the “software” which means to ensure behavior change necessary to come along with the sanitation hardware. A review of these approaches reveals several shortcomings, most importantly that they do not provide behavioral change interventions which correspond to psychological factors to be changed. This article presents a sound psychological model, which postulates that for the formation of new habitual behavior, five blocks of factors must be positive with regard to the new behavior: risk factors, attitudinal factors, normative factors, ability factors, and self-regulation factors. Standardized tools for measuring the factors in face-to-face interviews are presented, and behavioral interventions are provided for each factor block. A statistical analysis method is presented, which allows the determination of the improvement potential of each factor.",

    "Abstract Note": "Household demand for improved sanitation in developing countries is an important social and behavioral process with implications for public health, sanitation policy and planning, and sanitation design and technology development. This paper develops a behavioral approach to assess household demand for improved sanitation in Ghana. Adoption decision stages of preference, intention, and choice to install a toilet in Ghana are defined, measured in a survey, and used to estimate sanitation demand, identify factors affecting demand at each stage, and classify households by adoption stage to identify targeted demand-stimulation strategies. Results from a representative national sample of 536 households indicate that of 74% of households without any home sanitation, 31% have some likelihood of installing a toilet within the next year, but only 6% are very likely to do so; 62% had not considered the idea. Motivating and constraining factors are compared at each adoption stage and strategies likely to increase toilet installation in Ghana discussed. The approach is useful for assessing behavioral indicators of sanitation demand in developing countries and suggesting where marketing approaches can and cannot work to accelerate adoption of household sanitation improvements.",

    "Abstract Note": "Communicating knowledge about energy transition is a challenge of sustainable development. Serious games are a possible approach to explain complex relationships and present them to citizens. This paper discusses the development process of the serious board game “Changing the Game—Neighbourhood”. Therefore, this paper describes our approach of developing a serious game with co-designers in four phases and illustrates the process using an example. Doing so, the paper focus on two central challenges: (1) How can a serious game be developed for the energy transition, which keeps a balance between learning and playability? (2) How can co-design contribute to the development of a serious game? We found out that the use of prototypes and the inﬂuence of diﬀerent stakeholders as informants, co-designers, and testers were crucial for the expansion of the learning content, the improvement of the gameplay, and the balancing of the diﬃculty level. In addition, the energy transition at the neighborhood level appeared to be a suitable topic for a serious game.

    "Abstract Note": "An energy access assessment conducted by Practical Action in 2018 as part of the Renewable Energy for Refugees project established that most households and small enterprises in Kigeme, Gihembe and Nyabiheke refugee camps in Rwanda had limited or no access to electricity. It also identified both demand in the camps for modern energy services and a willingness and ability to pay. To address the lack of access to electricity, two solar home system companies operating in Rwanda were supported by the project to access the camps and supply systems to refugees and the host community via marketbased delivery models. This paper applies the diffusion of innovations theory as a framework to investigate the sales of solar home systems in the camps. It is the first paper to present data in this area and it assesses both the viability of market-based delivery of solar home systems in refugee camps and the suitability of using diffusion of innovations theory in these contexts. The results indicate that solar home systems can provide an advantage to households compared to existing energy solutions and are, in most cases, compatible with refugees' basic energy needs and expectations. However, the cost of systems remains a barrier and without subsidy, further reductions in costs or adaptations to payment models, solar home systems are unlikely to provide large proportions of households and small enterprises in the camps with access to energy. This seriously impacts the possibility of achieving Sustainable Development Goal 7 and for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to achieve the objectives it set out in its Clean Energy Challenge policy.",

    "Abstract Note": "Cooking with modern energy fuels and technologies has a high potential to positively impact the users’ health and well-being, and make cooking safer and less burdensome for women and girls. To date, there have been numerous interventions targeting improved cooking solutions in displacement settings, but very few which have involved modern energy cooking, such as ethanol, biogas, LPG or electric cooking. They have been largely absent from humanitarian programming due to limited availability, affordability and lack of business models that suit those complex settings. Additionally, energy access services in displacement settings have historically relied primarily on grant-based funding. However, grants are limited to relatively short timeframes which do not align with the long-term needs of the displaced. New ways of funding energy access in displacement settings, and particularly modern energy cooking services, are urgently needed to address the scale of the challenge as the number of displaced surpassed 80 million in 2020, with close to 90% having little or no access to adequate cooking fuels and technologies. In this paper, we review modern energy cooking in displacement settings and the common ways of funding and delivering them. We argue that new ways of funding and delivering energy access in displacement settings are urgently needed to address the scale of the challenge and to facilitate transitions to modern energy cooking fuels and technologies, in line with Sustainable Development Goal 7 and the principle of ‘leaving no one behind’.",

    "Abstract Note": "Access to clean, safe and sustainable energy – the focus of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 – is one of the principal needs of developing-country populations, for cooking, heating, light, communication, study, livelihoods and security. But people who have been forced to flee their homes, some 80 per cent of whom find refuge in low- and middle-income countries, nearly always remain outside national energy policy and planning mechanisms, even though most live and work within a local economy.  This research paper draws on five case studies – focusing on Ethiopia, Jordan, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda – to explore how humanitarian efforts to scale up access to sustainable energy for refugees and other displaced communities are affected by policy and governance structures in host countries.  The authors underscore that national energy polices and ambitions for low-carbon development pathways need to be accompanied by frameworks that support integration and self-reliance for displaced people, including through rights to work, move and participate freely in host economies. Equally, humanitarian organizations need to prioritize structures, processes and fundraising mechanisms that enable them to attract investment for sustainable energy initiatives and deploy resources carefully and meaningfully.",

Also, the need of working in collaboration with all potential stakeholders. The details and the issues raised in the paper are exactly in line with definition, design and implementation of co-design/spectrum of co-design.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\" dir=\"ltr\">This paper discusses the challenges and opportunities of providing inclusive and sustainable energy solutions in refugee camps. There are still many unanswered questions as to how to deliver energy in a sustainable, efficient and cost-effective manner in refugee camps. This work highlights the need for evidence-based assessments and development of comprehensive delivery approaches. While many humanitarian energy projects do not include an assessment or design phase, detailed assessment before project implementation is critical to ensure long-term success. A lack of quality data can lead to poorly designed interventions. To understand the full range of energy needs, qualitative and lived experience information is also essential. Humanitarian agencies need to develop sustainable interventions that work directly with refugees, displaced people, and host communities to access reliable, more affordable and sustainable energy to support the transition of refugee camps to self-reliant and economically developed spaces. Finally, the study emphasizes that delivering wide-ranging sustainable energy solutions in refugee camps is complex and requires collaborative efforts from different stakeholders taking into account people’s existing knowledge, energy practices, experience and learning from the private-sector to going further and faster together in the delivery of reliable, affordable, modern and sustainable energy for refugees.</p> <p><br></p> </div>",

    "Abstract Note": "Abstract                            An inadequate understanding of the energy needs of forcibly displaced populations is one of the main obstacles in providing sustainable and reliable energy to refugees and their host communities. Here, we provide a first-order assessment of the main factors determining the decision to deploy fully renewable mini-grids in almost 300 refugee settlements in sub-Saharan Africa. Using an energy assessment survey and publicly available traditional and earth observation data, we estimate a total electricity demand of 154 GWh yr               –1               . This figure includes lighting, air circulation and phone charging for 1.15 million households and the estimated demand of almost 59,000 microbusinesses and around 7,000 institutional loads. Using a set of techno-economic modelling tools, we thus compute a corresponding upper-bound total up-front cost of providing electricity access of just over US$1 billion. Deploying solar photovoltaic mini-grids instead of diesel implies avoiding greenhouse gas emissions for 2.86 MtCO               2e               over 20 years.",

    "Notes": "<div data-schema-version=\"8\"><p>In this paper, it is discussed how private sectors are important for the sustainable supply of modern and sustainable energy services in humanitarian settings and the paper argues that creating an enabling environment for private sector involvement is essential. As it is presented above co-design is involving different stakeholders and to involve such sectors policy and regulation is necessary that favors the involvement of such stakeholders. Therefore, including a policy element on the co-design toolbox could be helpful for energy practitioners in the humanitarian settings.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\" dir=\"ltr\">The paper highlights the increasing trend of humanitarian organizations towards the adoption of sustainable energy practices in programming, including the supply of renewable energy facilities and locally available energy markets. The paper identifies two emerging trends that enable the comprehensive delivery of sustainable energy solutions in displacement settings: aligning humanitarian relief with development objectives and harnessing market-based models and partnerships with the private sector. National coordination models are presented as an effective way to achieve this alignment, with the paper highlighting two examples from Jordan and Kenya, which illustrate the potential for sustainable energy solutions when displaced populations are included in national or sub-national development planning. The paper also identifies the need for partnerships with the private sector, given the insufficient public funds for the growing humanitarian crisis. However, there is little to no guidance on how to effectively operationalize private sector engagements between humanitarian organizations, development actors, host governments, and the private sector. The study suggests streamlining and centralizing coordination as a way to clarify roles and responsibility amongst actors and set clear policy environments for private sector engagement.</p> <p><br></p> </div>",

It examines the differences between these terms and their implications for policy and practice. The article argues that local integration involves the long-term settlement of refugees in a host country, while local settlement focuses on immediate shelter and basic needs. Local solutions, on the other hand, involve sustainable and context-specific approaches that address the root causes of displacement. The article concludes that disentangling these concepts can help to develop more effective policies that support the rights and needs of refugees and their host communities.</p> <p></p> </div>",

    "Abstract Note": "Recent developments have opened a window of opportunity for driving scale. Clean cooking is being elevated to a higher priority on the policy agenda; better definitions and in-depth data and research tools are making it possible to understand households’ cooking energy needs and sector dynamics; and technological advances, aided by new payment and financ- ing approaches, are putting modern-energy cooking solutions within reach of many more low-income households. At the same time, impact-driven forms of finance are gaining ground as a way to pay for the expected public-goods benefits from clean cooking interven- tions. The World Bank’s Clean Cooking Fund—the largest dedicated fund for galvanizing political commitment, scaling up public and private investment, and catalyzing innovation— is using innovative Results-Based Financing (RBF) designs and applications to promote long-term market development and advance access for all. Lessons and success stories from the World Bank’s recent operational experience in the sector show how making access to clean cooking a political priority, using people-centered approaches, can drive large development impacts for society. To unlock a country’s clean cooking pathways, stakeholders must carefully consider its overall enabling environment, including its institutional capacity to implement transformative solutions. In countries with a high access deficit, addressing the cooking poverty issue will initially require modernizing the biomass fuel sector and promoting integrated, cost-effective approaches. The Clean Cooking Fund’s first IDA co-financed project in Rwanda offers a promising example of how a pro-poor approach can be used to fill the affordability gap and incentivize local stove design and technology innovation.",

    "Abstract Note": "Research can contribute to better understanding of the forced migration experience to inform policy and programming, but it can also cause inconvenience and harm to research respondents.[1] In situations of forced migration, the stakes are particularly high because of precarious legal status, unequal power relations, far-reaching anti-terrorism legislation, and the criminalization of migration. In response, the Canadian Council for Refugees, York University’s Centre for Refugee Studies, and the Canadian Association for Refugee and Forced Migration Studies collaborated to complement established ethical principles with specific ethical considerations for research with people in situations of forced migration. This document highlights our guiding principles and applies the ethical concepts of voluntary, informed consent; respect for privacy; and cost-benefit analysis. It is of relevance to anyone involved in gathering information—whether in an academic or community setting—and those who are asked to take part in research.",

The approach aims to empower communities to take collective action towards ending open defecation and promoting the construction and use of toilets.</p> <p>CLTS begins with a process of community mobilization, which involves creating awareness of the negative impacts of open defecation on health and well-being. The approach then utilizes a series of participatory tools, such as transect walks and mapping exercises, to help communities identify areas where open defecation is most common and to develop their own plans for constructing toilets and promoting better hygiene practices.</p> <p>CLTS has been adopted in many countries around the world and has been credited with significant improvements in sanitation and hygiene, particularly in rural areas. The approach is based on the principles of community participation, empowerment, and ownership, and it has been recognized as an effective and sustainable approach to promoting sanitation and hygiene at the community level.</p> <p>CTLS has the potential to be applied to the humanitarian setting and has significant value to the energy sector - especially when it comes to clean cooking.</p> </div>",

    "Abstract Note": "Co-design is fundamental to humanitarian engineering and increasingly recognised as such in engineering curricula. However, it is challenging to teach, learn, and assess. In this paper, we describe the development and validation of a scenario-based instrument to distinguish novice and expert approaches to co-design in the context of humanitarian engineering. The instrument assesses the extent to which respondents describe stakeholder participation in each of the scope, design, and deliver phases of the design process, with co-design experts taking a collaborative approach throughout. We analyse and compare responses to the instrument from first-year undergraduate engineering students and experienced humanitarian engineering practitioners. Implications for educators, to use this scenario-based assessment in their own research, teaching, and curriculum development, are discussed in detail.",

    "Abstract Note": "Cities all over the world are setting ambitious targets of achieving zero carbon emissions and 100% renewable energy in the near future. Such energy transitions are highly complex societal processes, however, necessitating intensive collaboration among regional and national governments, energy companies and utilities, research in­ stitutions, advocacy groups, and local communities. Although there has been a rising interest in collaborative approaches such as co-creation in energy transition studies, existing literature on this topic sometimes lacks theoretical rigour or faces problems in practical application. This poses a challenge in assessing what makes cocreation useful for accelerating energy transitions. The aim of this paper is to critically review co-creation and other selected collaborative approaches across the public sector literature in order to develop an assessment framework for co-creation in strategic planning for energy transitions. Based on this review, we suggest that cocreation can be assessed according to the following criteria: 1) the involvement of actors (state, market, com­ munity, and third sector) and their roles in different phases (initiation, design, and implementation) of cocreation; 2) the use of four sets of activities (expectation alignment, social learning, resource acquisition, assessment, and evaluation) to foster transformative power; and 3) the outcomes of co-creation. The latter may include new knowledge, new relationships, and new solutions, as well as increased efficiency and social acceptability of the transition processes. We illustrate the application of this conceptual framework with an example from an ongoing energy transition led by the ProjectZero organization in Sønderborg, Denmark.",

It provides a set of tools and methods that enable practitioners to engage with market actors in a collaborative manner to identify opportunities and constraints, design interventions that address systemic issues, and monitor and evaluate their impact. The approach promotes inclusive market development, which not only benefits the target communities but also strengthens the market system as a whole. PMSD has been utilized in various sectors, including agriculture, energy, and other industries, and has proven effective in addressing complex market challenges. The revised version of PMSD has an increased focus on gender and participation, which is critical in promoting equitable and sustainable market development.</p> </div>",

    "Abstract Note": "Energy security and development in refugee settlements is hampered by limited data on the existing energy ecosystem, which is necessary to understand current energy needs and plan short- and long-term energy tran­ sitions to self-sustainment. This study addresses the knowledge gap by acquiring primary data from two neighboring refugee settlements, Ayilo I and Ayilo II, in Northern Uganda. A mixed-methods approach obtained data on energy supply and use for households, small- to medium-sized enterprises, and public services. Reduced fuelwood availability in one settlement decreased household wood use by 23.4% relative to the adjacent set­ tlement, and led to households spending an average of 121.8% and 33.5% more per month to purchase wood and charcoal, respectively. Findings indicate current short-term energy decisions are unsustainable and that a move towards using alternative thermal energy sources is needed to reduce the deforestation and lessen tensions with host populations. The study also identifies electricity use in households that primarily consists of cellphones, lighting, and radios, that are best served by solar home systems or charging stations. Electricity demand from small- to medium-sized enterprises is rising to follow aspirations of business owners to expand services offered, whereas energy demand from public services is high with some issues in the reliability of existing power infrastructure. Findings also suggest that hybrid mini-grids can meet the growing demand of small- to mediumsized enterprises, provide reliable power to critical public services, and accommodate for the growth in elec­ tricity demand for refugee settings transitioning from temporary, semi-permanent, to permanent settlements.",

    "Abstract Note": "The Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) provided a mechanism for academia to undertake projects relevant to the Sustainable Development Goals but there have been limited opportunities to critically interrogate such projects. In this paper we will use the Technology Implementation Model for Energy to deconstruct the purpose, assumptions and expectations, engagement strategies, and reflective processes of four GCRF projects in order to better understand relationships between researchers and those being researched. Thus, the aim of this paper is to explore and understand the lived experiences of four inter-disciplinary GCRF Primary Investigators implementing poverty alleviating technologies in a range of sectors to generate recommendations that can be applied to wider academic communities engaging with vulnerable populations. Our key findings show that despite the integration of Theory of Change models and the Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) framework in GCRF-funded projects, project aims continue to be driven by researchers rather than reflecting end-user needs. Whilst some projects looked to generate feelings of ownership, adequate engagement strategies and reflective learning practices, these processes are often not formally embedded in project activities resulting in a decoupling of researcher expectations and end-user assumptions – ultimately derailing project outcomes. Our recommendations for academics operating within the International Development space are to 1) Talk early, often and transparently, 2) Keep Thinking – who benefits?, 3) Be reflective, responsive, and open to change and, 4) Use a systematic approach to facilitate this process.",

    "Abstract Note": "Coming up with innovative solutions which have the potential and reach to scale up to masses is crucial to solve rural challenges and bring about their upliftment. Many technologies or technology-based solutions fail to create a change or an impact on the beneficiaries due to various reasons. One of the prominent reasons being the lack of ability to engage the community in designing the solution. This paper discusses in detail the co-design methodology that was used to design and develop an innovative and acceptable cooking stove for a rural community in Odisha. The workshop on co-design was conducted as part of the experiential learning program called Live-in-Labs®. In this process, the interdisciplinary team of students along with the village women collaboratively engaged in the design process. The preparation, plan, and implementation of a co-design workshop for design and development of an improved cook stove is presented in this paper. The workshop, which spanned for 4 days, enabled an effective user acceptance of the designer intervention. We have recorded the tools and methodologies we used that is discussed in detail here. The paper also captures the interactions among the designers and users where large disparity in terms of knowledge, language, gender and age was observed. The observed favorable and unfavorable factors are discussed in detail. We found that the level of engagement is directly proportional to the level of ownership (of the mutually developed solution) by the community, thus ensuring sustainability.",

    "Abstract Note": "Energy services are essential for the protection of basic human rights and dignity. Since 2014, energy issues have been incorporated in the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) global protection strategies. Off-grid solar photovoltaic (PV) power solutions can now provide cost-effective clean electricity in camps comprising large populations of internally displaced people and/or refugees. Through microgrid modelling and risk analysis, business models that could provide affordable and appropriate energy to displaced communities are outlined in this paper. The proposed PV microgrid build-own-operate (BOO) business models for camps of displaced populations consider providing for household and institutional demands, and a combination of the two. It is concluded that sustainable energy services can be provided to humanitarian agencies to power their compounds and community services such as health clinics and administrative centres. A fixed tariff of US$1/kWh is viable provided: the local fuel prices are greater than US$0.6/L at the point of use, and the capital costs of a backup or existing diesel generator are already covered. A fixed price tariff mitigates running costs for humanitarian agencies. In addition, by leveraging the institutional energy demands, basic electricity services to up to 500 households for mobile phone charging and lighting could be provided for a monthly tariff of US$1.5 per household, which is favourable compared to the estimated of US$4 monthly cost of kerosene for a typical displaced person’s household. The proposed solution will reduce costs and improve the sustainability of humanitarian operations while achieving the UNHCR goals by providing electricity to displaced persons for lighting and communications.",

    "Abstract Note": "PURPOSE: This case study provides a high-level overview of the human-centered design (HCD) or \"design thinking\" process and its relevance to public health. DESCRIPTION: The Best Babies Zone (BBZ) initiative is a multi-year project aimed at reducing inequities in infant mortality rates. In 2012, BBZ launched pilot programs in three US cities: Cincinnati, Ohio; New Orleans, Louisiana; and Oakland, California. The Alameda County Public Health Department (ACPHD), the lead for the Oakland BBZ site, identified HCD as a promising approach for addressing the social and economic conditions that are important drivers of health inequities. HCD is a process for creating innovative products, services, and strategies that prioritizes the needs of the intended population. ACPHD partnered with the Gobee Group (a social innovation design consultancy) to develop the Design Sprint. The Design Sprint was a 12-week pilot in which 14 professionals from nine organizations used the HCD process to develop concepts for stimulating a vibrant local economy in the Oakland Best Babies Zone. ASSESSMENT: Thirty- to sixty-minute semi-structured interviews were conducted with all 14 individuals involved in the Design Sprint. With the exception of one interview, the interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and inductively coded to identify themes. CONCLUSION: Our experience suggests that HCD can: enhance community engagement; expedite the timeframe for challenge identification, program design, and implementation; and create innovative programs that address complex challenges.",

    "Abstract Note": "In order to mitigate climate change and its impacts, it is crucial to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy sources. The extent to which renewable energy projects can be implemented largely depends on public acceptability. We studied how public acceptability is influenced by people’s trust in agents responsible for renewable energy projects and the influence that people have over decisions regarding these projects. As expected, higher trust and having influence over major decisions regarding the project led to higher project acceptability. Public acceptability was lowest when people had low trust in responsible agents and when people could only influence minor decisions regarding the project. We found a similar pattern of results in our samples in the Netherlands and China, providing initial evidence that trust in responsible agents and public influence over decisions may have similar effects on public acceptability of renewable energy projects across different countries and cultures.",

    "Notes": "<div data-schema-version=\"8\"><p>In the present tradition of humanitarian energy access it lacks the involvement of the private sector in the sector. One of the key aspects of co-design is the involvement of key stakeholders including the private sector, which missed in the trends of energy access in humanitarian settings. This is due to the lack of an enabling environment and encouragement mechanisms for the private sector to be involved. To have a complete and successful co-design in humanitarian settings creating an enabling environment that attracts the contribution of every potential stakeholder is essential. With this regard, this report discusses policies and strategies required to encourage private-sector participation and involvement in humanitarian energy interventions/projects related to finance, where it proposes innovative financing mechanisms. On the other hand, this report gives insights on how to incorporate financing mechanisms in the co-design process. The report underscores the importance of co-design principles in humanitarian settings, particularly regarding financial mechanisms for private-sector involvement in energy interventions. By incorporating stakeholder collaboration, considering project-specific risks, and exploring innovative financing structures, it aims to address the unique challenges faced in displacement settings and ultimately contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goal 7.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\" dir=\"ltr\">This report provides an overview of the financial mechanisms required to encourage private-sector participation in humanitarian energy interventions. These interventions are necessary to meet Sustainable Development Goal 7 by 2030, particularly in displacement settings where there are unique challenges that inhibit the uptake of cleaner energy solutions. Traditional financing approaches may not work in such an underdeveloped market, so alternative structures are needed, such as blended financial instruments. These structures should be specific to the risk and type of project and can include grants, results-based financing, and impact bonds. Displacement settings represent a complex and unpredictable operating environment, requiring not just smart mobilization of financing but also policy and technical interventions to create a more enabling environment for donors, NGOs, the private sector, and potential investors. The authors recommended exploring specific productive and public energy projects coupled with technical assistance to support market data, pipeline development, and project implementation is necessary. They also suggested that researching the merits of a global pooled facility versus more localized and project-specific approaches, and the creation of a dedicated group to aggregate projects across humanitarian settings is essential.</p> <p><br></p> </div>",

    "Abstract Note": "Achieving Sustainable Development Goal 7 - universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services by 2030 – represents a considerable challenge. Currently, 40% of the global population do not have access to sustainable energy sources, and instead rely on burning biomass to satisfy their energy needs. Despite a long history of energy technology for poverty-alleviation initiatives across the globe, many interventions fail at persuading end-users to continue using these technologies beyond an initial adoption phase. Whilst many champion sustainable energy solutions, most evaluation approaches do not consider long term sustained use. As a result, many end-user-orientated energy solutions, such as Improved Cookstoves (ICS), fall out of use once project partners depart. These failures are often due to emphasis on ever-more-complex technologies rather than social methodologies such as understanding end-user priorities and the complex contextual barriers to sustained use. In this paper, we present a novel interdisciplinary formative and evaluative implementation or delivery model, the qualitative Technology Implementation Model for Energy (TIME), for practitioners and policymakers. TIME focuses on refining three core areas of energy technology implementation; to rethink how impact is defined, to understand differences between practitioner perception and end-user reality, and to champion a co-produced approach with all key stakeholders in the energy system. TIME is the first energy implementation model to blend Social Enterprise, Appropriate Technology, Water, Hygiene and Sanitation behavioural change models as well as International Development planning tools whilst advocating an approach centred around co-production, ownership, use of resources and equality.",

    "Abstract Note": "Approaches to providing sustainable energy in cities have generated considerable interest in academic and policy circles. The development of this body of work, however, has not shed much light on the modes of intermediation that are needed to reconfigure urban energy systems towards sustainability in energy-poor countries. This paper focuses on the role of academics as knowledge intermediaries who can trigger cross-sector collaborations around innovations for a sustainable energy transition in African cities. The research presented here was generated by an interdisciplinary research team made up of partners in Kenya, Uganda and South Africa. The research partners set out to better understand how sustainable energy transitions can be achieved through collaborative efforts between community members, experts and policy actors in the three countries. This paper provides evidence-based reflections on how the research partners used participatory methods to facilitate solution co-design and knowledge co-production over a period of two years under the Leading Integrated Research for Agenda 2030 in Africa (LIRA 2030) program. A key knowledge outcome of the research partnership is an improved understanding of how transdisciplinary research across the sub-region can be used to unearth the socio-spatial, cultural and political dimensions of energy in relation to other urban services such as health and housing. Based on this understanding, the paper proposes transdisciplinary co-design as a promising approach to providing sustainable energy in urban informal settlements in Sub-Saharan Africa.",

    "Notes": "<div data-schema-version=\"8\"><p>This paper presents the development of a new approach to address the challenges of energy access in humanitarian settings which is developing a new framework for designing sustainable energy solutions in displacement settings. The framework combines sustainability considerations with co-design principles, enabling the creation of sustainable interventions and business models that align with the local context. This paper could be taken as a reference for the co-designing toolbox for humanitarian energy practitioners, since it considered the principles of co-design in the development of the proposed framework.&nbsp;</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\" dir=\"ltr\">This paper introduces a novel framework for designing sustainable energy solutions in displacement settings. The framework emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive and structured approach to enhance sustainability practices within the humanitarian and development sectors. By incorporating various sustainability aspects and existing planning tools, as well as promoting co-design principles, inclusivity and energy access can be improved. It illustrates the practical application and potential of co-design in humanitarian settings by implementing the framework in the design of a solar mini grid in Djibouti's Holl Holl refugee camp. This approach encourages active participation from all stakeholders, including the displaced community, humanitarian practitioners, and local partners, in the planning and design process. By involving these stakeholders, the energy interventions can effectively address the specific needs and preferences of the camp's residents. The framework combines sustainability considerations with co-design principles, enabling the creation of sustainable interventions and business models that align with the local context. It challenges the prevailing sectoral and short-term thinking within the humanitarian sector, prioritizing long-term sustainability and empowering the displaced population. Generally, the study presents a roadmap for integrating co-design principles into the planning and design of energy access interventions in humanitarian settings. Through the involvement of all stakeholders and the consideration of their perspectives, this framework facilitates the development of more effective and sustainable energy solutions that contribute to the well-being and resilience of displaced communities.</p> <p><br></p> </div>",

    "Abstract Note": "The article broadly examines how humanitarian aid for Rohingya refugees inadvertently harmed poorer hosts and adversely affected local capacities for peace. The article also discusses possible ways of easing tension and improving social cohesion in the refugee-hosting areas, while also highlighting how policy- and mandate-related constraints hinder a humanitarian response anchored in the \"Do No Harm\" principle. Finally, the article concludes with the argument that the humanitarian agencies should not just limit themselves to identifying the unintended consequences and lapses in the intervention. Instead, the Do No Harm principle should lead humanitarian aid agencies to make an active effort to accept responsibility for the harm while taking all necessary steps to mitigate or avoid harming in future interventions.",

    "Abstract Note": "We are often told that data are the new oil. But unlike oil, data are not a substance found in nature. It must be appropriated. The capture and processing of social data unfolds through a process we call data relations, which ensures the “natural” conversion of daily life into a data stream. The result is nothing less than a new social order, based on continuous tracking, and offering unprecedented new opportunities for social discrimination and behavioral influence. We propose that this process is best understood through the history of colonialism. Thus, data relations enact a new form of data colonialism, normalizing the exploitation of human beings through data, just as historic colonialism appropriated territory and resources and ruled subjects for profit. Data colonialism paves the way for a new stage of capitalism whose outlines we only glimpse: the capitalization of life without limit.",
