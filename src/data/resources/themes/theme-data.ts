        group: "Core concept of collaborative Design Process",
        description: `Whilst the idea of replicability (the ability to copy and paste using the same resources) is embedded in many humanitarian organisations, true scalability is often reserved for the private sector - how can the two learn from each other to create more effective and efficient humanitarian programs?`,
